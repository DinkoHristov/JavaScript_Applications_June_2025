[]()**Working with Remote Data**

For the solution of some of the following tasks, you will need to use an up-to-date version of the **local REST service**, provided in the lesson’s resources archive. You can [read the documentation here](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server).

Each exercise must have package.json file with the following parameters: 

**"test": "mocha tests",**

**"start": "http-server -a localhost -p 3000 -P http://localhost:3000? -c-1"**

Look package.json in previous lecture for example.
1. ## **List Towns**
You are given an **input field** with a **button**. In the input field you should enter **elements** **separated** by comma and whitespace ("**,** "). Your task is to create a simple **template** that defines a **list** of towns. Each **town** comes from the **input** field. The list should be **rendered** inside the element with Id "**root**".

This is how the HTML should look like with the rendered template:

1. ## **HTTP Status Cats**
We all love cats. They are also a fun way to learn all the HTTP status codes.

Your task is to create a **template** to represent an **HTTP** **cat card**. After you have **created** the template, **render** all the cats into the section with **id "allCats"**. Note that there should be a **nested <ul>** inside the section.

An **HTTP** **cat** has an **id, statusCode, statusMessage** and **imageLocation**. The cats are **seeded** using the **function** from the JS **file** named **"catSeeder.js"** – import this file as a module.

Each card block has a **button** that **reveals** its status code. You should **toggle** the button and change its text from "**Show status code**" to "**Hide status code**".

See the file **example.html** for an example of how the rendered HTML should look like.

1. ## **Search in List**
An HTML page holds a **list** of towns, a **search** box and a **[Search]** button. Create a template for a list, containing all towns, that can be easily updated when the user performs a search. The list should be rendered inside the **<div>** element with **id "towns"**. Load the values from the file **towns.js**, which you can import as a module.

Implement the **search** function to **apply class "active"** to the items from the list which include the text from the **search** box. Also print the number of items the current search **matches** in the format **"<matches> matches found"**. The search should be **case-sensitive**.

See the file **example.html** for an example of how the rendered HTML should look like.

1. ## **Fill Dropdown**
Create functionality that **loads list items** from a remote service and displays them inside a **drop-down** menu. The user should also be able to **add new items** to the service by entering them in the **input** field on the page and submitting the form. Create a **template** for the **drop-down list** and the **items** inside it that can be **easily updated** with new entries.

When the program starts, the data should be automatically retrieved from the server via GET request from URL **http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/advanced/dropdown** and rendered as **<option>** items inside the **<select>** with **id "menu"**. Upon form submission, send a **POST** request to the same URL and if it is successful, update the list of options with the newly created item.

Each item has a property **text** entered by the user and **\_id**, which is generated by the server. When creating the HTML elements, use the **\_id** as option **value** and **text** as option **textContent**.

**Example**

This is how the rendered HTML should look like:\

1. ## **Table – Search Engine**
Write a function that **searches** in a **table** by given input. Create a **template** for a **table row**, which can be **easily updated** with class values when the user performs a search. Load the data from the following URL with a GET request: **http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/advanced/table**

![](Aspose.Words.88f51273-68c7-464a-a853-bede10a38ce3.010.png)

When the "**Search**" **button** is **clicked**, go through all cells in the table body and check if the given input is **included** anywhere. The search should be **case-insensitive**.

If any of the rows contains the submitted string, add a **select** class to that row. Note that more than one row may contain the given string. If there is no match **nothing** should be highlighted.

**Note:** After every search, **clear** **the input field** and **remove** **all already selected classes** (if any) from the previous search, in order for the **new search** to contain only the **new result**.

See the file **example.html** for an example of how the rendered HTML should look like.
### **Example**
For instance, if we try to find **eva:**

![](Aspose.Words.88f51273-68c7-464a-a853-bede10a38ce3.011.png)

The result should be:

If we try to find all students who have email addresses in **softuni** domain, the expected result should be:

1. ## **Book Library**
Create **templates** for **all items** on the page, as you see fit. See the file **example.html** for an example of how the rendered HTML may look like. You are free to add attributes that would help you implement the required functionality.
### **Get All Books**
First task is to "**GET**" all books when the button "Load All Books" is clicked. To consume the data from the API, send a request to the **following URL**: **http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/collections/books**

![](Aspose.Words.88f51273-68c7-464a-a853-bede10a38ce3.014.png)
### **Create Book**
Initially, the form with **id "add-form"** should be displayed. Write functionality to create a new book, when the submit button is clicked. Before sending the request be sure the fields are not empty (make validation of the input). To **create** a book, you must send a "**POST**" request and the JSON body should be in the **following** format: 

**{**

`  `**"author": "New Author",**

`  `**"title": "New Title"**

**}**
### **Get Book** 
Send a "GET" request to the following url:

**http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/collections/books/:id**
### **Update Book** 
By clicking the edit button of a book, display the form with **id "edit-form"** and populate its fields with the information from the selected book:

![](Aspose.Words.88f51273-68c7-464a-a853-bede10a38ce3.015.png)

The HTTP command "**PUT**" **modifies** an existing HTTP **resource**. The URL is:

**http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/collections/books/:id**

The JSON body should be in the **following** format:

**{**

`  `**"author": "Changed Author",**

`  `**"title": "Changed Title"**

**}**
### **Submitting Your Solution**
Place in a **ZIP** file the content of the given resources including your solution. Exclude the **node\_modules** folder if there is one. Upload the archive to Judge.
